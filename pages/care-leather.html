      <h1><span class="step-number">0.</span>Information</h1>
      <p>It's important to take care of the leather to prevent it from drying up. How often this has to be made depends on how often and in what weather the shoes are used. A pair of shoes that are used all year around and exposed to rain probably needs to be treated three or four times a year. Many shoe creams contain color pigment that also helps the leather to regain its luster and to cover marks and scratches. </p>
