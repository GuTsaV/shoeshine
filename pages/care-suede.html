      <p>Taking care of suede is simple. A suede brush in rubber is used to brush the surface to make it look more vivid. A suede brush with brass bristles can be used if the suede has tough stains. A waterproofing spray will make the shoes water repellent and prevent stains. Waterproofing spray for suede can be found with pigment that is great if the shoes has lost some of their luster. </p>
