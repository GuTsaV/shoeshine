      <h1><span class="step-number">0.</span>Information</h1>
      <p>Despite taking good care of a pair of shoes, they will start to look boring after a while. Maybe they have gotten a lot of scratches, become very dirty or old shoe cream is building up in the creases... That means it's time to completely wash them and apply new fresh shoe cream. Don't be afraid of soaking the shoes in water, they will handle it alright as long as they can dry properly. </p>

      <h1><span class="step-number">2.</span>Clean with solvent</h1>

      <p>Let the shoes dry for at least a day with shoe trees inserted. The shoe trees make sure that the shoes will maintain their shape. Let the shoes dry on their side, like the picture shows, to make sure the sole gets a chance to dry. </p>

      <h1><span class="step-number">6.</span>Done</h1>
      <p>The shoes are now free from dirt and shoe care products and they might also have lost some of their colour. The next step is to apply shoe cream again to moisturise and repigment the leather. <a href="{{ "/care-leather.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Keep reading here</a>. </p>
