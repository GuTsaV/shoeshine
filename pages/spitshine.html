      <p>If you want your shoes to really shine, you've come to the right place. Polishing shoes to achieve a mirror shine is often called spitshine or bullet shine. This is accomplished by thin layers of shoe polish and small drops of water. The water will react with the terpentine in the polish and form a shiny surface. It's important to build up the surface from multiple thin layers of polish, five layers is probably a minimum. </p>

    <div class="instructions">
      <h1><span class="step-number">2.</span>Apply polish</h1>
      <p>Apply a small amount (see picture) shoe polish onto the shoe. Rub it in using small circular motions in a fast pace. </p>

      <h1><span class="step-number">3.</span>Polish</h1>
      <p>The surface might become a little bit dull at first, but continue polishing for a minute. Then, wait a couple of minutes and let the polish set. </p>

    <div class="instructions">
      <h1><span class="step-number">4.</span>Polish and water</h1>
      <p>Repeat step 2 and 3 above, but when you have rubbed the polish out a little, add a drop of water and continue the polishing. Continue until the polish has completely been smeared out and then a little bit more. The picture illustrates the amount of water that is appropriate. </p>

  <div class="step">
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="images/lp5.jpg" alt="Apply more layer of shoe polish" title="More shoe polish!" />
    </div>
    <div class="instructions">
      <h1><span class="step-number">5.</span>More layers of polish</h1>
      <p>Wait a couple of minutes and redo the same procedure as many times as you want. The wait between the layers is important, otherwise there's a risk of dissolving the previous work. After about five layers, the shine should be visible. </p>
      <p>Polishing shoes with shoe polish in layers like this is only worthwhile doing on the toe part and heel of the shoe. The others parts of the shoes are soft and the shoe polish will crackle. </p>
